# CompSci
A bunch of Java for usage in my Comp Sci class. Expect messy code.

## Instructions: 

Create a Dictionary application which prompts the user for minimum of 3 unidentical words and display the words in alphabetical order. On the next line, ask the user if they want to run the program again. When the user agrees to run the program again, repeat the process, otherwise display “Thank you for using the dictionary.”

## Program Run Sketch:

```
Do you want to start using the dictionary (yes/no)? yes

Enter a word (check your spelling carefully): tiger

Enter another word (check your spelling carefully): Elephant

Enter one more word (check your spelling carefully): zebra

You have entered the following words:
ELEPHANT
TIGER
ZEBRA

Would you like to use the dictionary again (yes/no)? no

Thank you for using the dictionary.
```

### Tips:

Make sure you correctly initialize and close the Scanner class.

Make sure you use the most efficient loop structure.

Note the display of user input words are in UPPERCASE.
